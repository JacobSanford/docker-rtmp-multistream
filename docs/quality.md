# Performance and Quality
## Hardware Requirements
Re-encoding video, especially for gaming streams, is CPU-intensive. Use a CPU with as many cores/threads as possible.

## Network Requirements
Generally, the quality of a stream is determined by the bitrate (the amount of data transmitted per second) of the video and audio. The higher the bitrate, the better the quality of the stream.

This means that the quality of the stream is directly related to the amount of network capacity (bandwidth) you have available.

Relaying a stream to multiple services requires even more bandwidth than streaming to a single service. Ensure you have enough bandwidth to support the combined bitrates of all the streams.

### Network Capacity
You can test your upload speed using a service like [Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/).

### Limited Capacity
If your connectivity's upload speed is limited, you will need to either stream at either a lower resolution or frame rate. Which one should you choose? This depends on the type of content you are streaming.

  - **High Motion (FPS, IRL)**: Consider reducing bandwidth by streaming at a high frame rate but lower resolution.
  - **High Detail, Low Motion (Puzzle, RTS)**: Consider reducing bandwidth by streaming at a high resolution but lower frame rate.
